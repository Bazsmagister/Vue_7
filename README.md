The scoped attribute is a boolean attribute.
When present, it specifies that the styles only apply to this element's parent element and that element's child elements (not the entire document).
Note: The scoped attribute is deprecated and will be removed. Do not use it.

A resource class represents a single model that needs to be transformed into a JSON structure.

API Resource is a transformation layer. if you don't want to output eloquent models 1:1.

the data wrapping is also a plus, if you want to output previous/next... links and/or some other metadata in the result

??You have to enable CORS so you can access your API from the frontend application:
composer require barryvdh/laravel-cors
Testing the POST/PUT/DELETE requests is a bit more involved and requires an external tool (for example, cURL or Postman). You also need to make sure that the following headers are sent with each request:
Accept: "application/json"
This header tells Laravel to return any validation errors in JSON format.
